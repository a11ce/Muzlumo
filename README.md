# Muzlumo

A simple music visualizer.


## Prerequisites

You need python3, [PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/), [aubio](https://aubio.org/), [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), and [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org).

pip3 install pyaudio aubio numpy pygame
```

## Usage

Muzlumo will listen with the microphone, route your computer's output to the input while monitoring it to have it work on the computer's output. If you're on macOS, try Soundflower or Loopback.
